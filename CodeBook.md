subject:   
1..30: *Integer*. A unique identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

activity:   
{ WALKING, WALKING\_UPSTAIRS, WALKING\_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING }: *Factor*. An activity performed by the subject.

Variables 2..81:   
-1..1: *Numeric*. The average normalized signal of the mean or standard deviation of the time or frequency domain feature
for each activity and each subject.
Time is measured in seconds, frequency in Hz.

## Feature Selection

The features come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix *'t'* to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into *body* and *gravity* acceleration signals (*tBodyAcc-XYZ* and *tGravityAcc-XYZ*) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain *Jerk* signals (*tBodyAccJerk-XYZ* and *tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ*). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm
(*tBodyAccMag*, *tGravityAccMag*, *tBodyAccJerkMag*, *tBodyGyroMag*, *tBodyGyroJerkMag*). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing *fBodyAcc-XYZ*, *fBodyAccJerk-XYZ*,
*fBodyGyro-XYZ*, *fBodyAccJerkMag*, *fBodyGyroMag*, *fBodyGyroJerkMag*. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
*'-XYZ'* is used to denote 3-axial signals in the *X*, *Y* and *Z* directions.

The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in *'features.txt'*.
